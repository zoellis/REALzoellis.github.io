This was done through pulled Minnesota Tree Growth Data.\n\n\n\nLab 2\n\n\n\n\n\nLab 3\nLab 3 was working with one of the largest data sets throughout the semester where I learned to compare datasets through patchwork.\n\n\n\nLab 3\n\n\n\n\n\nLab 4\nI learned how to perform t-tests and other statistical testing in R. I also learned how to perform an ANOVA test that I later used for my final presentation.\n\n\n\nLab 4\n\n\n\n\n\nLab 5\nI proposed my topics for our final research. I learned how to embed bibliography citations for my chosen articles.\n\n\n\nLab 5\n\n\n\n\n\nLab 6\nI learned how to programmatically download and access data, as well as compare models with workflows.\n\n\n\nLab 6\n\n\n\n\n\nLab 7\nI made a manuscript folder where I kept all of the prospective authors I was going to use for my project.\n\n\n\nLab 7\n\n\n\n\n\nLab 8\nI learned about Machine Learning processes, where I put together everything I have learned into a complete system.\n\n\n\nLab 8\n\n\n\n\n\nLab 9\nI set up my project in a palatable format where the methods and results flowed. I also learned about drafting a good analysis of my results.\n\n\n\nLab 9\n\n\n\n\n\nLab 10\nI learned how to build sf objects from R packages and CSV files, as well as manipulating coordinate systems.\n\n\n\nLab 10\n\n\n\n\n\nLab 11\nI gave my Final Project Lightning Talk and learned about science communication and presenting data to my class.\n\n\n\nLab 11"
