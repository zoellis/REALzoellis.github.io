In the Spring of 2025 I took a class Quantative Reasoning class based in R. I wrote some code, and did some cool data science. Here is a collection of links! 

## Building a Project Website

### Lab 1
- In this assignment we built a static user site with GitHub Pages.  
- Includes a GitHub repo for access to all the code.  
- Look at how high quality my work is!

### Lab 2
In this lab, I got to get my first experience working with `dplyr` to better summarize and manipulate data. This was done through pulled Minnesota Tree Growth Data.

### Lab 3
Lab 3 was working with one of the largest data sets throughout the semester where I learned to compare datasets through `patchwork`.

### Lab 4
I learned how to perform t-tests and other statistical testing in R. I also learned how to perform an ANOVA test that I later used for my final presentation.

### Lab 5
I proposed my topics for our final research. I learned how to embed bibliography citations for my chosen articles.

### Lab 6
I learned how to programmatically download and access data, as well as compare models with workflows.

### Lab 7
I made a manuscript folder where I kept all of the prospective authors I was going to use for my project.

### Lab 8
I learned about Machine Learning processes, where I put together everything I have learned into a complete system.

### Lab 9
I set up my project in a palatable format where the methods and results flowed. I also learned about drafting a good analysis of my results.

### Lab 10
I learned how to build `sf` objects from R packages and CSV files, as well as manipulating coordinate systems.

### Lab 11
I gave my Final Project Lightning Talk and learned about science communication and presenting data to my class.
